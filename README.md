# Hospitality-Project

The Hospitality project focused on evaluating important performance indicators such as overall revenue, occupancy rates, booking cancellations, total reservations, and capacity usage. It included an in-depth analysis of trends related to weekday and weekend revenues, booking behaviors, and revenue breakdown across different states, hotels, and categories. The project also studied bookings that were completed, canceled, or marked as no-shows, while highlighting major weekly trends in revenue generation, booking volumes, and occupancy levels. Furthermore, it offered valuable insights into demand prediction, customer behavior patterns, and operational effectiveness, ultimately supporting better resource management and boosting overall business efficiency.
